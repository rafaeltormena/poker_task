# poker_task


This project will generate output based on the following request:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InL9BwYu9jMgJS_HxLsTb4r2A_LCJhWxpxf-eZfx2L4/edit


Just download both python files and run with some input file like:
> python3 main.py input.txt
You can run the code with one single input or a big file with at least one blank line between each input


Some problems found in the example inputs/outputs:
- Shown cards in example C from players RomaTroy and RS932 are inverted
- Some % calculation of the stack balance have errors
